    <h2>Different between (div) and (span) elements in HTML</h2>
        <p>The main difference between div and span elements in HTML is that div is a block-level element and 
            span is an inline element. This means that div creates a new line and can contain other block or 
            inline elements, while span stays on the same line and can only contain other inline elements</p>
